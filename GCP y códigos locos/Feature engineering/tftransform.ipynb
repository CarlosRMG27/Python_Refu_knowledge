    "While Pandas is fine for experimenting, for operationalization of your workflow it is better to do preprocessing in Apache Beam. This will also help if you need to preprocess data in flight, since Apache Beam allows for streaming. In this lab we will pull data from BigQuery then use Apache Beam  TfTransform to process the data.  \n",
